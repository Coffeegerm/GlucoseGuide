# Glucose Guide

Glucose Guide is a diabetic logbook that is aimed to be simple and easy to use,
but pack the features any user might need or want from their logbook. 
If there is a feature missing from the app that you wish to see, please make an 
issue and I'll try to add the feature in a future update.

If an error is apparent in the app, please feel free to make an issue and to let me know!

Patches are encouraged, and may be submitted by forking this project and submitting a pull request. 
I aim to create a very open app for people to help make better.
